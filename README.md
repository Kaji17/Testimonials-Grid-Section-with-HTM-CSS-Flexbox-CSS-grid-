### What I learned

I learned how to build grid-like layouts with a combination of flexbox and CSS grid

### Continued development

UI intend to complete my skills in front-end development, which is why I will continue my learning with the use of js in my projects and also the use of a SASS preprocessor and the Bootrasp framework
